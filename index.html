    <h1>BowDown097's Site</h1>

    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my personal website. Here I'll cover my thoughts and recommendations on various technologies, such as operating systems, as well as provide insight on my personal projects. As you can tell, this is in development. More will be coming soon.</p>

    <!-- <h2>About Me</h2> -->
    <h3>Contacts/Platforms</h3>
    <ul class="contacts">
        <li style="list-style-image: url(images/discord.png)"><a href="https://discord.com/users/371476477335699457">Discord</a>: I definitely use this the most.</li>

        <li style="list-style-image: url(images/youtube.png)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BowDown097">YouTube</a>: All of my video content is on here. Mainly memes. I also hardly upload.</li>

    <h3>Programming Skills</h3>
    <p>I'd like to consider myself decently proficient when it comes to programming. Currently, I most actively program in C++ (with and without Qt), C#, and Python, and occasionally dabble in C and JavaScript. My history with programming dates all the way back to when I was 7 years old and learned very basic Visual Basic for the sole purpose of trolling my friends. I have also learned and dropped multiple other languages up to this point, and am currently interested in learning and expanding my knowledge in others. You can read all about that <a href="about-me/programming.html">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Software and Software Philosophies</h3>
    <p>I use Artix Linux as my daily driver, and have since December 2020, although I have used Linux seriously since around mid 2019 when I picked up Xubuntu. I am a huge supporter of software minimalism and free and open source software, and try to use software that follows those ideas. You can see all of the individual software I use and why, as well as alternatives and software I moved from where applicable <a href="about-me/software.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Stuff I'm Working On</h3>
    <p>What's currently occupying my time.</p>
    <dl>
        <!-- BLOONS MODS -->
        <dt><a href="projects/bloons-mods.html">Bloons Mods</a></dt>
        <dd>I have made various mods for Bloons TD 6 (<a href="https://github.com/BowDown097/BTD6API">as well as a C++ API for the game</a>), and soon plan to do the same for Bloons TD Battles 2. I host a very large Discord server for Bloons TD 6 mods (26000 members as I write this!) which you can find <a href="https://discord.gg/QS4BvrE">here</a>.</dd>
        <!-- PROGRAMMING -->
        <dt><a href="about-me/programming.html">Learning Programming Languages and Frameworks</a></dt>
        <dd>I am currently learning C and expanding my knowledge of Python and the Qt framework through various small projects that I don't care enough to put on GitHub (besides <a href="https://github.com/BowDown097/winsperg">this one</a> because I thought it was nifty). Soon, I plan to take on Haskell as I haven't really explored functional programming, say for watching a couple videos on it. I don't really think I'm going to like it, but whatever.</dd>
        <!-- RUSH REBORN -->
        <dt><a href="projects/rush-reborn.html">Rush Reborn</a></dt>
        <dd>A primarily Bloons-centered Discord server with <a href="https://github.com/BowDown097/RRBot">a custom economy/music/community bot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BowDown097/BloonsTD6-Versus">a Battles mod for Bloons TD 6</a>, as well as community events like elections, debates, games, raids, and Watch2Gethers. This will eventually extend to a server for Bloons TD Battles 2 mods. Heavily inspired by John (BTD Blaze It)'s Rush and set to open soon!</dd>
